    <h2>About Me: s</h2>

    <h3>History:</h3>
    <p>Welcome to my HTML page. My name is <strong>Johann Suarez</strong>, born and raised 
        in the Philippines. By 2018, I emigrated here and immediately began
        studying in VIU. I'm currently in my second year of Computer Science.
        I like Mathematics, Programming, and Computer Graphics.
        These areas of interest give my life meaning, and it's when a project/endeavor
        makes them all intertwine that <em>I feel truly grateful for existing.</em>
    </p>

    <h3>Interests:</h3>
    <p>By the grace of God and a close friend of mine, I had to learn HTML/CSS/JS
        during the December break. So this task is relatively easy.
        The creative freedom allowed to us makes this course something to
        really look forward to, and I'm excited to meet everybody
    </p>
